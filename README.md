## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

### About me:
My name is Angela The (she/her), and I'm a software engineer who's passionate about civic tech (specifically, improving public service and benefit delivery). Previously, I earned my M.S. in [Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago (2023) and was a Civic Innovation Corps Fellow at Coding it Forward (2022).

### Currently:
- ðŸŒ± Using React, Typescript, Python, R, Swift, Go
- ðŸŒ± I'm excited to explore how the intersection between social policy & civic tech can improve civic engagement and public services/benefit delivery.
- ðŸŒ± My policy interests include criminal justice, family & child policy, early childhood education, housing, and social welfare.
